The Gift Economy Engine
=======================

Goals
-----

 - Provide a platform by which people can connect and build community around [the idea of the Gift Economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy)
 - Facilitate the spread of surplus goods in areas of abundance
 - Build trust and accountability within local communities
 

Origins
-------

Like many, I was first introduced to gift economy through the Burning Man festival, but it didn't make complete sense to me, so I read more about it. Looking further into the ideas behind gift economy I learned that, in areas of abundance such as ours, it is more about community and connection than staging a movement against commerce. So I joined two online gift economy forums for my area (Portland, Oregon).

These communities stumble over the same challenges over and over -- 

 - How can I ensure my stuff gets to someone who will make good use of it?
 - How can I find people who are reliable and trustworthy?
 - How can I establish meaningful connections with others who are passionate about giving?
 - How can I ensure those who have limited mobility can still participate?

I watch a lot of good-hearted people offer up their goods to an open community and have to navigate problems around transportation, communication and flakey recipients. Things like surplus produce go to waste when those who commit to picking them up never show up.

After a lot of thought, I was sure that these questions and stumbling blocks could at least alleviated by software. Hackbright gave me an opportunity to truly think through these challenges and how I might go about addressing them in a web application.

So.. In a world of Craigslist and Freecycle, how do you provide a great vehicle for people to give stuff away?


Thinking through the problems
-----------------------------

Accountability is a big problem in an online gift economy forum, and even worse when trolling Craigslist and Freecycle. It's easy to raise a hand promtply when you want something, and then fail to follow up if it becomes inconvenient to make arrangements to pick it up.

_Step one: Increase accountability_
