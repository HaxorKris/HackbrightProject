The Gift Economy Engine
=======================

Goals
-----

 - Provide a platform by which people can connect and build community around [the idea of the Gift Economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy)
 - Facilitate the spread of surplus goods in areas of abundance
 - Build trust and accountability within local communities
 
Origins
-------

Like many, I was first introduced to gift economy through the Burning Man festival, but it didn't make complete sense to me, so I read more about it. Looking further into the ideas behind gift economy I learned that, in areas of abundance such as ours, it is more about community and connection than staging a movement against commerce. So I joined two online gift economy forums for my area (Portland, Oregon).

I watch these communities stumble over the same challenges over and over -- 

  How can I ensure my stuff gets to someone who will make good use of it?
  How can I find people who are reliable and trustworthy?
  How can I establish meaningful connections with others who are passionate about giving?
  How can I ensure those who have limited mobility can still participate?

After a lot of thought, I was sure that these challenges could be overcome or at least alleviated by software.

Hackbright gave me an opportunity to truly think through these challenges and how I might go about addressing them in a web application.
